# Request Yo Racks (Now)!

The city of Austin offers the possibility to apply for the [free installation of bike corrals on the right of way/parking spot close to businesses](https://www.austintexas.gov/page/bicycle-parking). The process requires the requester to write an email to a specific service of the city, and include additional information about the location and the business owner(s).

But there are two problems with this approach:

* The first problem is that people do not want to spend the time to write the email and collect the necessary information.

* The second one is that, in spite of the fact that the people in charge of the program are willing to help, the process is not completely straightforward:
> "There will generally be at least a few back and forth messages associated with a bike parking request."

“Request yo rack” proposes to simplify the process by automating all these tasks, and reducing the requester efforts to 3 simple steps:

1. Select the location on the map
2. Review/Edit the information
3. Submit
